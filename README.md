## My process

### Built with

- HTML and CSS for frontend development
- Python with Flask framework for backend development
- TMDB API for movie data
- Bootstrap for responsive design and styling
- Jinja2 for template rendering
- RESTful API principles
- Git for version control

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to retrieve data from an API and integrate it into a web app. I also learned how to use Flask for the back-end features of a web app. Another new concept that I learned through this project is pagination.

### Continued development

Going forward, I'd like to expand my use of CSS and Bootstrap on this web app to make it more visually appealing. I also plan on adding the option to search for movies or tv shows. 

### Useful resources

- [How to Create a Python Web App with Flask](https://www.sourish.dev/blog/tutorials/flask.html) - This article helped me learn how to build a web app using Flask and an API. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Pagination in Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U18hO1ngZEQ) - This is a great video that gave me an idea of how to set up pagination in Flask.
